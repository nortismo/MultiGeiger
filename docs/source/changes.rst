Changelog
=========

V1.14.0 2020-05-16
------------------------------

New features:

* implement status line on OLED display (see docs), #257
* also support BME680 sensor for temperature, humidity, pressure
* display time up to 60s / 60m / 24h / 99d, then roll over
* speaker/LED: timer-driven sequencer, hw PWM sound, #35
* TLS support

  - add clock module, use NTP to set the clock
  - use persistent per-server HTTPClient instances
  - use connection: keep-alive for web requests
  - add https capability (can be used for sending data)
  - note: transmission to sensors.community and madavi is still using http!

Fixes:

* fixed GM pulse debouncing, #248
* pulse counting: deal with microseconds uint32 overflow, #273
* check WiFi status before trying to transmit
* fix race condition, #286

Other changes:

* dip switches: only read once at boot time, #207
* new font (u8x8 uses 8px width anyway)
* slow down main loop
* toilet -> custom server, add comments about toilet usage, #214
* refactor/simplify pulse counting ISR, bookkeeping in main loop, #220
* refactor big main loop into smaller functions with local bookkeeping.
* misc. other code cleanups
* loraWan: removed unused/not needed code, #212, #234
* removed meeting notes, #294
* docs:

  - README improvements (board name, flash size, partition scheme, passwords,
    LoRa)
  - update development/release docs (create/test binaries, IDE settings, ...)

V1.13.0 2020-04-14
------------------

* auto-detect hardware (STICK vs. WIFI) by hardware pin
* use config web page for more values (userdefines.h has the defaults), #140
* try both adresses of BME280
* LoRa payload changes, e.g. to fulfill 'TTN Fair Access Policy'
* send additional data to servers
* send to MADAVI in one single request both geiger and thp data
* new logging with DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL configuration
* integrated travis-ci:

  - for compile checks (platformio, wifi and stick build)
  - for style checks (using the "astyle" CPP checker)
* source: modularization, cleanups, less globals, ...
  (quite huge internal changes, please help testing!)
* building:

  - platformio-based build: suppress lmic_project_config.h usage
  - arduino-ide-based build: you still need to edit that file
* use bump2version tool for project version bumps, #169
* docs:

  - added upgrade hints for 1.13 in README on github
  - https://multigeiger.readthedocs.io/ == the beginning of
    new (sphinx / reST-markup based) online docs, #163
  - add a basic, short README in English (also for online docs)
  - include infos about project name, #121
  - moved changelog.md to docs/source/changes.rst
  - updated/fixed development docs, #46
  - update docs about new 5V power supply / cabling, #122
  - description of LoRa Payload updated
  - other docs improvements / fixes
